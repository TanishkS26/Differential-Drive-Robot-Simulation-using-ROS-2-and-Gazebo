# Differential-Drive-Robot-Simulation-using-ROS-2-and-Gazebo
This project simulates a differential drive mobile robot in ROS 2 and Gazebo, integrating physics-based modeling with real-time control. Using Xacro/URDF for robot design, Gazebo plugins for actuation, and a ROSâ€“Gazebo bridge for communication, it provides a complete pipeline to test robotics algorithms virtually before deploying to real hardware.
